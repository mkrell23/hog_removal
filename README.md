# MY FAKE BUSINESS WEBSITE

This is a website for a fake company. It has HTML and CSS and now JavaScript so it is very fancy.

Click the button at the top! Click it again! This is my greatest pride. The slideshow is mostly "borrowed" code, so this is written from scratch.

Things I hope to have on it in the future:
* Make the words pretty
* Make the columns attractive
* Make the form less fugly
* What is the footer doing? Fix that too
* Other fancy things

This is not my strongest area, but we got through it. I already miss the hardware side. When is the C++ class?
